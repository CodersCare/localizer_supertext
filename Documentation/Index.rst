The Supertext Localizer Translation plugin allows you to create and manage professional translation projects of your site right out of the TYPO3 user interface.
Supertext is one of the worlds leading language service providers (LSP) and provides high-quality translations into more than 100 languages. For more information visit https://www.supertext.com
The plugin is built using the well known combination of the TYPO3 extensions Localization Manager (L10mgr) and its GUI, the Localizer. While the L10mgr provides exports and imports of records and files, the Localizer with the Supertext Translation plugin takes care of all the necessary steps in between. Editors wonâ€™t have to deal with any L10mgr configurations anymore and can order, review and publish translated sites all within their familiar TYPO3 environment.
